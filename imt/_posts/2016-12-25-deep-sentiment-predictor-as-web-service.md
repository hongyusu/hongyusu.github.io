I have been thinking for a long while to build a web service for sentiment analysis, the idea of which is tell the emotional positivity (negativity) given a piece of text.  
Despite of the potentially huge and interesting applications or use-cases, we will be focusing the sentiment analysis for tweets.

Basically this article is telling what happened and how.
As a short summary, I have trained a sentiment prediction model using IMDB review data.
The model is essentially a Convonlutional Neural Network (CNN) using pretrained sentiment140 word2vec as embedding layer.
The implementation of the model is through Keras API running tensorflow as backend.
The web service is built with Python flask and hosted in Heroku.
