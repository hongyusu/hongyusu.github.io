# Basic concept

1. `Heap` is data structure organized by a binary tree in which the value of a parent node is greater than its children (max `heap`).
1. `Heap` in Python is implemented with the `heapq` module including the following functionalities
   1. `heapq.heappush(heap, item)`: push an item into heap
   1. `heapq.heappop(heap)`: pop an item from heap
   1. `heapq.pushpop(heap, item)`: push an item into heap and pop an item from heap
   1. `heapq.heapify(list)`: transform a list into heap 
   1. `heapq.heapreplace(heap, tiem)`: pop an item from heap and push an new item from heap
1. Time complexity of a binary `heap`
   1. Insertion: O(logN)
   1. Deletion of min: O(logN)
   1. Remove: O(logN)
   1. findMin: O(1)
1. Time Complexity compare to other data structures

   |Structure|Insertion|Deletion of Min|Remove|findMin|sort|
   |:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
   |`heap`|O(logN)|O(logN)|O(logN)|O(1)|O(NlogN)|
   |ordered`array`|O(N)|O(1)|O(1)|O(N)|O(N)|
   |unordered `array`|O(1)|O(N)|O(1)|O(N)|O(NlogN)|
   |`BST`|O(logN)|O(logN)|O(logN)|O(logN)|O(N)|

## Kth Largest Element in an Array

1. [Kth Largest Element in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/) problem is defined as to find the kth largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.
1. The problem can be approached with a heap data structure where
   1. First to construct a heap array with all numbers in O(nlogn) time
   1. Then pop k times, each pop operation uses O(1) time
1. An example Python solution using `heap` and internal sort is given as the following
```python
class Solution:
    # @param {integer[]} nums
    # @param {integer} k
    # @return {integer}
    def findKthLargest(self, nums, k):
        '''
        '''
        #return solution_sort(nums,k)
        return solution_heap(nums,k)
import heapq
def solution_heap(nums,k):
    h = []
    for num in nums:
        h.append(-num)
    heapq.heapify(h)
    print h 
    res = []
    for i in xrange(k):
        res = (heapq.heappop(h))
        print res
    return -res
    pass

    '''
    use build-in sort
    '''
    if len(nums) == 0: return None
    nums.sort()
    return nums[len(nums)-k]
    pass

## Sliding Window Maximum
1. [Sliding Window Maximum](https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum/) problem is defined as given an array nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.
1. `heap` approach: add element into a heap one by another, in each step
   1. Pop an element from heap until the index is within the k different from the current index
   1. The solution roughly takes O(nlogn) time
1. 'deque' approach:
   1. Maintain a `deque` structure
   1. In each iteration
      1. if the `deque` is empty, add current number into the head of `deque`
      1. pop the element from the tail of the queue when its index is out of range
1. An example Python solution is given as the following
```python
class Solution:
    # @param {integer[]} nums
    # @param {integer} k
    # @return {integer[]}
    def maxSlidingWindow(self, nums, k):
        return solution(nums,k)
def solution(nums,k):
    '''

    '''
    if len(nums) == 0: return nums
    h = []
    res = []
    for i in xrange(k):
        heapq.heappush( h, (-nums[i],i) )
    (val,i) = heapq.heappop(h)
    res.append(-val)
    heapq.heappush( h, (-nums[i],i) )
    print res
    for j in xrange(k,len(nums)):
        heapq.heappush( h, (-nums[j],j) )
        (val,i) = heapq.heappop(h)
        while i<j-k+1:
            (val,i) = heapq.heappop(h)
        res.append(-val)
        heapq.heappush( h,(-nums[i],i) )
    return res

## Merge k Sorted Lists
1. [Merge k Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/) problem is to merge k sorted linked lists and return it as one sorted list. 
1. The problem can be solved by maintaining a `heap` with $k$ elements, and in each step
   1. pop an element from the `heap`
   1. add one element from the corresponding list into `heap`
1. An example Python solution is given as the following
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

    if len(lists) == 1: return lists[0] 
    res = []
    h = []
    for i in xrange(len(lists)):
        if lists[i] != None:
            heapq.heappush(h, (lists[i].val,i) )
            lists[i] = lists[i].next
    while len(h)>0:
        (val,i) = heapq.heappop(h)
        res.append(val)
        if lists[i] != None:
            heapq.heappush(h, (lists[i].val,i))
            lists[i] = lists[i].next
    if len(res) == 0: return None
    print res
    head = ListNode(res[0])
    p = head
    for i in xrange(1,len(res)):
        tmp = ListNode(res[i])
        p.next = tmp

## The Skyline Problem
1. The goal of [The Skyline Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-skyline-problem/) is to find a contour formed by a collection of buildings.
1. The problem can also be solve with a `heap` structure in O(nlogn) time where n is the number of buildings from the input.
1. In particular, the solution will keep a active building together with a `heap` of buildings and in each iteration
   1. it takes in a new building
   1. if the new building is overlap with the active building, the algorithm will either put it into the heap if it is not as high as the active one or use it as a active building and push the previous active building into the `heap`
   1. if the new building is not overlap with the active building, the algorithm will work out the contour of the building in the `heap`.
1. An example Python solution is given as the following
```python

    # @param {integer[][]} buildings
    # @return {integer[][]}
