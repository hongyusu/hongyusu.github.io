I am a Postdoctoral researcher in <a href="http://www.ics.aalto.fi/en/">Department of Computer Science</a>, Aalto University, Finland. My research is along the direction of Machine Learning for Structured Data. Currently I focus on developing accurate learning models for structured output prediction. In general, I am interested in 

  - Structured Output Prediction / Max-Margin Learning for Multilabel Classification
  - Kernel Methods for Complex Data
  - Optimization Methods for Large-scale Data
  - Social Network / Influence Network Data Analysis
  - Bioinformatics, Metagenomics
