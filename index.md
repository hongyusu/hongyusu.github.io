I am a Postdoctoral researcher affiliated with <a href="http://www.hiit.fi">Helsinki Institute for Information Technology HIIT</a> and <a href="http://ics.aalto.fi/en/">CS Department Aalto University</a>. My research is along the direction of Machine Learning for Structured Data. Currently I focus on developing accurate learning models for structured output prediction. In general, I am interested in 

  - Structured Output Prediction / Max-Margin Learning for Multilabel Classification
  - Kernel Methods for Complex Data
  - Optimization Methods for Large-scale Data
  - Social Network / Influence Network Data Analysis
  - Bioinformatics, Metagenomics


##Educations

I did my **PhD** in the field of Information and Computer Science from <a href="http://ics.aalto.fi/en/">Aalto University</a> and <a href="http://www.hiit.fi">Helsinki Institute for Information Technology HIIT</a> during 2012.3 - 2015.4. Before that, I got my **MSc** from <a href="http://cs.helsinki.fi">University of Helsinki</a> and <a href="http://www.hiit.fi">HIIT</a> in 2010. I got my **BEng** from <a href="http://www.xidian.edu.cn">Xidian University</a> in 2007.

##Outside Research

I enjoyed aggressive sport like basketball before I broke my knee cruciate ligament. Now I opt to bouldering, scuba diving (holding <a href="http://www.padi.com/scuba-diving/padi-courses/course-catalog/open-water-diver/">OWD license</a>), snowboarding (downhill) that explores the unknown part of my life. I also enjoy hiking and traveling a lot for which I share some of the pictures on <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/123885344@N02/">flickr</a>.
