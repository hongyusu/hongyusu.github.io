I have been doing machine learning and AI for a while, about 5-6 years? My research is along the direction of Machine Learning for Structured Data. Currently I focus on developing accurate learning models for structured output prediction. In general, I am interested in

- **Optimization research for machine learning** - convex/non-convex optimization mostly
- **Structured output prediction / max-margin learning / multilabel classification**
- **Kernel methods for complex data** - achieving operation in high dimensional feature space with a low computation cost
- **Social network / Influence network analysis**
- **Bioinformatics / Metagenomics**
- **Recommender system** - recommending spatial objects 

Find [Here](https://github.com/hongyusu/Posters_and_Presentations/blob/master/Presentations/Research/example.pdf) some slides about the machine learning research I have been doing for a while :laughing:
