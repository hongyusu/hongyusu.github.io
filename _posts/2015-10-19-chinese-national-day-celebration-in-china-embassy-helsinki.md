Oh, I was invited to join the Chinese National day celebration happening in China embassy Helsinki. By the way, the invitation letter looks very impressive. Like it :thumbsup: I would assume the invitation letter is a byproduct of the [outstanding Phd candidate awards](http://www.hongyusu.com/life/2015/08/12/outstanding-doctoral-candidate-award-2014/) :relaxed:

Here comes the actual invitation letter. Pity that they got my name a bit wrong :wink: Guess Chinese characters are also difficult for Chinese people :sweat:
