## A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style

This is also known as _neural style_. It is a recent work in the filed of _deep learning_ and I think it's super cool. I have noticed it for a while already and let's take a close look at technology behind the scene.

First off, what _neural art_ does is to render an input image A with the visual experience learnt from another input image B. Particularly, the **content** of image A remains while the **style** is changed to the one used in image B.

This is a piece of the super interesting work in deep learning which I have been noticed for quite a while.




The project is also known as '_neural stype_'.
