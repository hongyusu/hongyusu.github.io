Last week, I received from our ambassador the **Chinese government award for outstanding doctoral candidate of 2014**.
This eventually marks an end to my life being a f*cking student. 
I am not trying to leave myself some clue about my student life in case I forget them one day.

I went to the key primal school in 1991 when I was about 6 or 7 year old. 
I began my junior high school, the best one in my city, in 1996 where I met some of my best friends in my life. 
Some of them are really good kids, while some of them are really bad ones. But lucky me!
I graduated from junior high with an outstanding grade which I did not even care about.
It's funny that my parent found out I was ranked top 10 or something in my city. 
They were so happy about me. But I just want to play basketball with my buddies all days.
Then I started to enjoy my senior high school during the year 2010-2013 with lots of lots of funs and the wonderful memories that I won't ever forget.
I was somehow turning from a good kid to a not-so-good kid and became a frequent visitor to my teachers' office for my dropping grade and bad attitude towards studies.
Thanks to my great teachers and my parents, I managed to get back to the right track and make through the college entrance examination with a grade that sent me to the one of the best technical university in China.
I missed my hometown so much with memories of my friends, my parents, and my pass.

For me, university is all right but not very excited. Probably because of the dull atmosphere created automatically by our computer science nerds.
I graduate in 2007 with my BEng and a ranking position that directly sent me to the graduate school without any additional examination.
I suddenly realized that I should go out and see the world outside when I was still young and nothing to worry about.
Then I went to University of Helsinki in 2008 and finished my MSc in 2010. 
I have to admit that life during 2008-2010 could have been more excited if I would enjoy myself more. But unfortunately, my peers they are just crazy about study which gave me no choice but joining them.
