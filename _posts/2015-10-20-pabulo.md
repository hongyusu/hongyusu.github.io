As you might notice already, this is my [_technical_ blog]({{ site.url }}/pages.html) hosted in [Github](https://github.com/hongyusu). The blog documents my work and life. With my cat **Pabulo**, my life is not very _technical_.

Oh, forgot to introduce, Pabulo is a very smart guy. I will write more about him :scream_cat:

I do have another cat which does like me very much :broken_heart: I will have another page for **her** as well. Just for your curiosity, she and Pabulo are nice couple however being neutralized. 

Again, on the _technical_ side, Github does not handle image well for which it throws away position information of the image. So help me god :laughing:
