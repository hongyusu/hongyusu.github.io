# Introduction

1. There seems to be an exponential growth for NIPS participants as shown in the following picture. It is said that about 10% papers are from deep learning and roughly 5% from convex optimization.
1. One big news in NIPS is that Elon Musk plan to commit 1 billion dollars to create a non-profit research organization known as [OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai/). See also the [press release of the New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/12/science/artificial-intelligence-research-center-is-founded-by-silicon-valley-investors.html?hpw&rref=technology&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=well-region&region=bottom-well&WT.nav=bottom-well&_r=1). OpenAI will base in San Fransisco with a long term goal is to create an artificial general intelligence (AGI) that is capable of performing intellectual task as human beings.
