# Introduction

1. There seems to be an exponential growth for NIPS participants as shown in the following picture. It is said that about 10% papers are from deep learning and roughly 5% from convex optimization.

1. One big news in NIPS is that Elon Musk plan to commit 1 billion dollars to create a non-profit research organization known as [OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai/). See also the [press release of the New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/12/science/artificial-intelligence-research-center-is-founded-by-silicon-valley-investors.html?hpw&rref=technology&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=well-region&region=bottom-well&WT.nav=bottom-well&_r=1). OpenAI will base in San Fransisco with a long term goal is to create an artificial general intelligence (AGI) that is capable of performing intellectual task as human beings. The funding for openAI is extremely high which makes people curious about what they are going to achieve after a few years.

   A researcher from OpenAI claims that the research will mostly be driven by empirical results rather than theory as they think in the field of neural network the empirical achievement is way ahead of the theory at the moment. At the same time, they don't restrict themselves on deep stuffs. 

1. A research startup [_the CurousAI company_](http://www.thecuriousaicompany.com/about/) based in Helsinki with partners from Aalto university and Nvidia. They have a paper in NIPS conference [semi-supervised learning with ladder networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.02672) and a 300m [presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5vNRvFfWLV9TjEteW4tYXJ4UWs/view?usp=sharing).

   Obviously, they only do stuffs in deep neural network.

1. My personal comment on these deep companies: I think deep learning involves more engineering work than scientific research. There is no problem for big company like Google and Facebook to invest money and brains for the purpose of making more money. Look at the funding member of both AI research companies, they are all deep learning people. AI or AGI are believed to be far more complicated than engineering. And I think deep learning is very premature to be a working horse of creating an AI or AGI. But throwing money to research is always a good sign :laughing:
