## Stack

1. `Stack` is a data structure that stores and processes the data according to '_first come last served_' policy.
1. We usually talk about `Stack` by comparing it to `Queue` which implements according to `_first come first served_` policy.
1. Operations with `Stack`
   1. `push()`, push an element on top of the stack
   1. `pop()`, remove an element from top of the stack
   1. `top()`, get an element from top of the stack
   1. `empty()`, check if the stack is empty
1. Here is a nice [tutorial](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~adamchik/15-121/lectures/Stacks%20and%20Queues/Stacks%20and%20Queues.html) about `Stack`.

## Related problems

Here are some interesting/difficult problems from LeetCode which are related to `Stack`.

### [Largest Rectangle in Histogram](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-rectangle-in-histogram/)

1. Given n non-negative integers representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, find the area of largest rectangle in the histogram.
1. An example Python code is given as the following
{%highlight Python%}
class Solution:
    # @param {integer[]} height
    # @return {integer}
    def largestRectangleArea(self, height):
        return solution(height)
def solution(height):
    height = [0] + height + [0]
    stack = [0]
    rtn = 0
    for i,x in enumerate(height):
        while x<height[stack[-1]]:
            # do something
            j = stack.pop()
            h = height[j]
            w = i-stack[-1]-1
            rtn = max(rtn,w*h)
        stack.append(i)
    return rtn
    pass

### [Maximal Rectangle](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximal-rectangle/)
1. Given a 2D binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest rectangle containing all ones and return its area.
1. This problem can be reduced to [Largest Rectangle in Histogram](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-rectangle-in-histogram/) by summing up and analyze rows one by another with a subroutine that compute the largest rectangle in Histogram.
1. An example Python code is given as the following
{%highlight Python%}
class Solution:
    # @param {character[][]} matrix
    # @return {integer}
    def maximalRectangle(self, matrix):
        '''
        codeing 29
        '''
        if len(matrix) == 0: return 0
        # initialization
        m,n = len(matrix),len(matrix[0])
        row = [0]*n
        val = 0
        # 
        for i in xrange(m):
            for j in xrange(n):
                if matrix[i][j] == '1':
                    row[j] += 1
                else:
                    row[j] = 0
            curval = process_a_row(row)
            if curval > val:
                val = curval
        return val
def process_a_row(xs):
    xs = [0] + xs + [0]
    stack = [0]
    res = 0
    for i, x in enumerate(xs):
        while x < xs[stack[-1]]:
            y = xs[stack.pop()]
            res = max(res, (i-1-stack[-1])*y)
        stack.append(i)
    return res
