## Motivations

- **Holiday!** Let's assume you have about two weeks' holiday and you want to organise a trip.

- **Tickets?** First thing you need to do is to search for flight tickets. You want to find the most cost efficient flight tickets but the question is which city you want to fly first. If you want three cities then you have six different combinations. Oh, you still need to know which day you want to fly. To find good tickets, you need to do **a lot of** search.

- **Hotels?** The next thing you need to do is to find the hotel to stay.

- **Attractions?** The next thing is to find tourist attractions for different cities in order to make yourself a tourist.

- **Restaurant?** Still, you are a food lover or a bear dreamer, you need to find good restaurants to eat dinners in different cities.

- **Buddies?** If you are traveling alone, you probably want to find a buddy to travel together.
