# Extra reading materials

There are always very good external reading materials available on the web. For example, this article ['A beginner's guide to Amazon S3 and web hosting'](http://www.smalldatajournalism.com/projects/one-offs/using-amazon-s3/) is a part of the website which is built for a practical course 'Small data journalism'. It offers very good introductory knowledge on hosting a website with Amazon services.
In addition, you can reed this article ['How to serve 100k users without breaking server'](http://blogging.alastair.is/how-i-served-100k-users-without-crashing-and-only-spent-0-32/) for more practical details on building a website with Amazon S3. Still, ['Getting started with AWS and Python'](http://aws.amazon.com/articles/Amazon-EC2/3998) offers a excellent running example (:question:) of running an small web application on Amazon using S3, EC2, and SQS.
